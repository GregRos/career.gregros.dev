Hi! I’m Greg. I’ve accomplished a lot in **eight years of professional experience** and over **twenty years of programming**. I made this site to help myself keep track of it all. 
# Summary
Like I said, I’ve done a lot, and you might not care about most of it. Here are some key points:
> [!recite|bg-pink] I’m a generalist
> I’ve learned numerous [[Languages]], technologies, libraries, paradigms, and frameworks. I’ve done client-side,  server-side, DevOps, system architecture, and plain old [[Perdido|system administration]]. I still love learning new technologies and trying to integrate them into my work. 
> 
> To top it off, I have a solid background in theoretical computer science, and I’ve implemented some pretty [[Imms|advanced data structures]].

> [!recite|bg-red] I helped grow a startup
> I’ve headed a [[REflectiz|startup]]’s technological development for five years, during which it grew from a handful of people to over fifty. **I made key decisions** that allowed the company to pivot based on market demands and scale up by a factor of 30.

>[!recite|bg-blue] I’m an Open-source Founder
>I’ve founded major open-source projects solving a wide array of real-world problems, such as [[Parjs|parsing]], [[Wampus|RPC]], and [[Preszr|object-graph serialization]]. Some are in active use and many have enjoyed popularity and multiple contributors.
