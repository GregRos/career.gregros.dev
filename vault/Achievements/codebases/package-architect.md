Reorganized a codebase into a package architecture spanning a dozen or so interlinked packages, with carefully planned out dependency structures.

Published [22 public packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~gregros "‌"), many of which are carefully designed, fully documented, and thoroughly tested libraries.

I’m really, really good at working with package-based codebases and I can make you one too.
