Expert on the Git version control system, including advanced knowledge about the systemâ€™s inner workings and experience using different clients â€“ graphical and otherwise.

Iâ€™ve done complex merges and rebases, helped countless developers with version control issues, and attempted to impart my knowledge to others. Iâ€™ve also designed version control development processes.

Iâ€™ve used and implemented both branching and forking models, set guidelines for PR structure and content, and decided on how PRs are merged.
