Iâ€™ve done in-depth research into the HTTP protocol in order to capture as much information from requests made by web browsers. This research went beyond the protocol itself and into adjacent or foundational protocols, such as TLS and TCP.

My focus has always been on web traffic sent by browsers, rather than other network-connected devices, but that also means I have extremely in-depth knowledge of how browsers do this.
