Implemented logging in a distributed system, including picking a log retention strategy, carefully balancing costs with increased observability.

Iâ€™ve also taught developers logging best practices, dealt with dozens of log-related performance and stability issues, designed schemas for log entries to increase searchability, and hand-wrote log formatters with pretty colors and emoji to make them more readable.
