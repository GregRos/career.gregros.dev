I’ve configured lots of different desktop Linux environments, using different frontends like X11, LXQt, KDP, GNOME, and so on. I’ve customized their appearance and configurations and created reusable machine images.

I’ve also set up remote desktop tools, like FreeRDP and NoMachine to be used as part of development workflows.
