I’ve securely configured web and network-related services and programs on Linux, like:

- Web servers, such as **nginx**, including security components.
- **SSL** certificates.
- Security services or components, such as **fail2ban.**
- **SSHD**
- File transfer servers such as **FTPS** and **Samba**
- Firewalls like **ufw**
