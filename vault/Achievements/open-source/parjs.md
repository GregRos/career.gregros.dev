Wrote [parjs](https://github.com/GregRos/parjs), a parser-combinator library written in TypeScript. The library is inspired by similar libraries in other languages, such as [FParsec](https://www.quanttec.com/fparsec), but has specific design choices that better reflect the TypeScript and JavaScript languages and ecosystems.

This library lets you parse any grammar you like, and do so by writing code you can understand. It has advanced features such as state management and some performance optimizations. Like almost everything I do, it has full documentation.
