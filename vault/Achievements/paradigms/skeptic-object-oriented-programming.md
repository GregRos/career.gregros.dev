Iâ€™ve been writing in object-oriented languages basically my whole life, which makes me sufficiently qualified to say that some aspects of this paradigm are overblown.

OOP patterns by themselves donâ€™t lead to better code, and in fact some aspects (like methods) emphasize tight coupling that can be avoided using other approaches.

This is in contrast to functional programming principles, such as immutability, functional composition, and parametric polymorphism, which make code more predictable, powerful, and reusable.
