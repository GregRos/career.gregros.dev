I’ve been doing functional programming for around ten years. I don’t remember how I got into it, but I read Okasaki cover to cover and thereafter wrote my own fully documented and tested [persistent data structure library](https://github.com/Gregros/imms "‌").

Everything I do has a tinge of functional programming and I embrace FP features wherever I see them.

I've also implemented many other functional programming patterns, such as a [parser combinator](https://github.com/GregRos/parjs "‌") library, and a lazy evaluation-focused [utility library](https://github.com/GregRos/lazies "‌").
