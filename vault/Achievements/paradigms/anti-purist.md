Paradigms are not answers, they are sets of abstractions that can be used to construct a system. These abstractions are basically separate tools sold as package deals, but you can rarely build anything with a single set of tools.

Instead, several sets of tools â€“ or abstractions â€“ should be used. This is the approach that most languages go with, combining OOP features with functional programming and other disciplines.

This is what engineering is â€“ taking abstract mathematical principles and turning them into tools for solving real world problems.
