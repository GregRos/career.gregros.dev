I’ve orchestrated a complex system in Kubernetes, with elements such as deployments, services, autoscalers, PVCs, ConfigMaps, network policies, and so on, while maintaining high code quality standards.

I’ve tried both Helm and Kustomize in an effort to reduce code duplication.

I’ve debugged microservices through Kubernetes and automated the process of setting up this sort of development environment.
