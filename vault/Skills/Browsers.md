Using the Chromium browser as a development platform, while writing minimal C++ code.
# Instrumentation
#place/reflectiz 
I developed a system that instruments almost all browser features that relate to web pages. Some of the things the system monitored:
- Dozens of web APIs
- HTTP and WebSocket traffic
- Cookies and other forms of storage
- 

This means the software must recognize, report, and sometimes modify any behavior the browser performs as a response to
- 
# Automation
#place/reflectiz
I’ve written a system that runs, automates, and controls Chromium instances using advanced, experimental, and internal APIs.
# Source Code
#place/reflectiz 
I’ve researched the Chromium sources, along with those of dependencies, to find workarounds for bugs, debug crashes, and find hidden internal features that allow for additional control over the browser.

I’ve also compiled custom versions that allow for control that couldn’t be achieved through other means.
