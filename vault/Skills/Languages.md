I’ve written in over 30 languages, starting with VB6 at the age of 12. Currently I’m a #typescript main, but I can write real-world code in many other languages, and some of them I use on the daily.

Here is a table showing some choice picks:

| Languages |  |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| #typescript | #javascript | #csharp |
| #python | #bash | #scala |
| #kotlin | #rust | #java |
| #cpp | #fish | #sql |
For me, learning a language means being able to write real-world code in it, as well as understanding its unique characteristics. 

So when I say I know #scala, I mean that I’ve written code that uses advanced features like higher-kinded types. When I say I know #cpp, it means I understand the difference between the different casts, how overloading the equals operator works, RAII, and so on.
