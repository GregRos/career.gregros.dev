# Systems
Iâ€™ve developed for the following database systems:
* MSSQL: #reflectiz, #eternitech
* Postgres: #appdome
* MySQL: #eternitech
# Schema Design
Iâ€™ve designed database schemas from scratch for commercial projects, deciding on which entities to store and how to do it, as well as the links between different tables. #eternitech 

Iâ€™ve written views, functions, stored procedures, and other elements that help a schema fully come together. #eternitech, #reflectiz
# Complex Queries
Iâ€™ve written complex queries that use various advanced database features. #reflectiz
- Multiple CTEs.
- Highly recursive queries.
- Meta-queries of database structures.
- Queries involving string manipulations
# Optimization
Iâ€™ve optimized queries based on the query plan, ancient database lore, opposite day logic, astrology, and the promises of long-dead gods. #reflectiz, #appdome, #eternitech.
