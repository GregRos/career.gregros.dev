Reflectiz provides a security scanner that detects client-side vulnerabilities in web applications.

Joining the company when it numbered a few people, I developed a browser-based platform for monitoring webpage activities and researched solutions for #chromium automation and control.

I rejoined the company during a period of growth. In my new role as the company’s tech lead, I continued my research while expanding the company’s infrastructure and development processes to meet the demand of dozens of paying clients.
