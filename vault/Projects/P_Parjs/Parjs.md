Parjs is a library for building parsers written in #typescript for any #javascript environment. It’s inspired by Parsec and FParsec.

# Why I wrote it
I was interested in writing a DSL, and had previous experience with parser combinators on a different project. However, I didn’t like any of the available parser combinator libraries at the time, so I decided to make my own.
# How it works
Parjs implements the parser combinator pattern, letting you make parsers for any language by combining:
- Simple building block parsers
- Combinators that modify those parsers
# Userbase
Parjs has a small but stable userbase. It’s frequently used by people experimenting with programming languages.
