Perdido is a personal media and gaming server, as well as a dozen other things. I use many of its features throughout the day. Itâ€™s a physical machine, a small enterprise server with a 1 Gbit line.

# How it works
Runs lots of services, each with its own user, each deployed from a specific bash script. Also, some scripts are just there to set up environments or stuff like that. Also has tons of shorthand tools for common admin tasks.

# Tools
These are microprojects associated with the server, but technically have a life of their own.

## [Sweeper](https://github.com/GregRos/sweeper)
A CLI tool for classifying and sorting media files, #python.

## [delete-media](https://github.com/GregRos/perdido/blob/master/delete-media/run.py)
A CLI tool for deleting hardlinks across multiple folders, #python.

## [pd-shortcuts](https://github.com/GregRos/perdido/blob/master/shell/pd-tools.fish)
Shorthand for common server administration tasks, written in #fish.

# Users
Two or three people.
