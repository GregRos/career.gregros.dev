FieldEditor is a #desktop #windows  application written in #csharp using #WPF that lets you edit specific offsets in binary files. It was written for game #modding.
# Why I wrote it
A lot of video games hard code important numeric values into the game binary. By carefully decompiling them itâ€™s possible to figure out these offsets and edit the game binary to change them.

This tool keeps a searchable database of these offsets and allows users to search and write to them easily.
# Userbase
More than I thought! I lost interest in the tool fairly quickly due to real life events, but it turns out to have been used by people after all.
