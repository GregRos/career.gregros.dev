Wampus is a client for the #WAMP RPC #protocol. It supports both #nodejs (through the `ws` package) and the browser. WAMP is an schema-less alternative to gRPC with a lot less hassle.

# How it works
It implements the protocol and provides a convenient API that follows many TypeScript conventions. Using observables made the complicated message flows easier to code.

# Userbase
Right now, only me. I feel like the library needs more work.
