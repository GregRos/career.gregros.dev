A static SPA written using #react and #typescript. It’s styled with #scss and #bootstrap, and bundling using #parcel. It’s related to #modding.

# What it’s for
I made it as a testbench for a mod for the game Slay the Spire. There were several parameters I wanted to tweak, and I thought it would be a cool way to experiment with them.

I also used it to practice my #frontend skills, which had been slowly rusting.
