# Laniakea (cluster)

-   Bare-metal Kubernetes cluster running directly on Laniakea (server).
-   Configuration managed in self-hosted GitLab instance.
-   System components deployed via GitOps CI/CD pipeline using Flux.
-   Bare-metal load balancing and provisioning systems.
-   Policy-based network isolation between services.

# Laniakea (server)

-   Enterprise-grade, rack-mounted, self-operated physical server.
-   Runs Linux (Debian), administered via SSH.
-   Enterprise-grade, rack-mounted, self-operated physical server.
-   Secured using a firewall, VPN (WG), IDS, auditing (NMap), PoLP.
-   Monitored using industry-standard tools and dashboards.

# open-source
