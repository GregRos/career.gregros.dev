Accelerated development by:

-   Increasing code reuse by refactoring existing code into a network of packages.
-   Identifying and overcoming bottlenecks in development processes.
-   Ensuring new features are scalable and maintainable.

-   (()) translating client demands into X

Transformed a monolithic system into a distributed highly scalable microservice pipeline.

Designed other distributed systems based on input from key stakeholders:

-   ?
-   ?
-   ?

Expanded the company's cloud assets through:

-   Converting the majority of said cloud assets to IaC.
-   Managing k8s clusters, deployments, services, and so on.
-   Managing Compute resources, disks, storage,

Expanded and administered cloud assets on GCP, such as GKE, Compute, GCR, AIM, and so on.

Communicated with stakeholders and cross functional teams towards:

-

-   Converting the majority of the company's cloud assets to IaC.
-   Administering GCP services such as GKE, Compute, GCR, Log Explorer, AIM, and so on.
-   Deploying advanced cloud network configurations using IP forwarding, cloud routers, etc.

Expanded the company's cloud (GCP) infrastructure by:

-   Converting the majority of the company's cloud assets to IaC.
-
-   Deploying advanced network configurations
-

Championed observability to ensure system performance and integrity by:

-   Deploying a tracing solution that allowed for rapid incident identification and response.
-   Designing a set of domain-specific metrics and visualizing them on a Grafana dashboard.
-

Took charge of a monolithic system and refactored it into a distributed, highly scalable microservice pipeline
