Thank you for that bit of information! Honestly, I'd appreciate anything you can tell me about the job market there, even if it's not great.

I do think that some companies might still sponsor me specifically. I have some pretty valuable domain knowledge owing to my previous role. Stuff like browser architecture and automation, web protocols, JS engines, and client-side security. 

You can't really just find people who know about things like that. Believe me, I've tried. That, plus my experience in building major production systems from scratch should get me somewhere.

I guess I might need a more direct approach if I wanted to sell myself that way, though.
