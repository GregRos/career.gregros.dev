I’m a software developer and architect with a wide range of skills and interests. I’ve done a lot, including client-side, server-side, devops, cloud architecture, and observability. I go wherever a task leads me, even if I have to dig through x86 assembly instructions to get there. 

My deeper passions are system architecture, type systems, and API design. To that end, I’ve built countless libraries – some popular, some not – for doing a wide variety of tasks, ranging from parsing to declaratively modifying compiled binaries. 

Over the years, I’ve mastered several platforms down to the bedrock, creating tools and systems that rely on that knowledge to perform a wide variety of tasks. Currently, I’ve achieved this level of understanding with:

- Client-side web technologies.
- JavaScript engines in general.
- The .NET runtime.

In my last position, I single-handedly built and designed a stateless, highly scalable system that ran, monitored, and controlled headless browsers. The system was capable of detecting and reporting all website activity, ranging from usage of JavaScript APIs to HTTP requests. This system was instrumental to the company's offering.

I further led development of a high-throughput data pipeline capable of digesting GB/s of graph data from a queue, encoding it, and writing it to a classical relational database, while doing research for a future move to graph databases. 

I am in a constant state of inspiration, my mind brimming with libraries I could write or systems I could build. I am always working on several things at once, with a dozen more things that are on hold but will eventually reach completion. It’s just the way my mind operates.
