\item Bare-metal k8s cluster (k0s) built with industry-leading
  open-source technologies.
\item Highly observable through dashboards (GitOps Weave, K8s dash)
  and tools (k9s, kubectl, kubeq).
\item Achieves high performance by avoiding virtualization overhead.
\item Hosts numerous services and platforms, including \textbf{gregros.dev}.
\item All resources managed in SCM following GitOps principles,
  reconciled using Flux.
\item Avoids vendor lock-in through pure k8s solutions, e.g.
  cutting-edge Gateway API.
\item Network exposure managed by industry-leading load balancing
  solutions (MetalLB, wg VPN)
\item Secured through namespaces, policy-based network isolation, and PoLP.
