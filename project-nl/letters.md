Hi Shir! 

I'm Greg, a software architect based in Israel. 

I've recently stepped down from a technical leadership position in a successful startup. The events in the country have convinced me I should try to build a life elsewhere, and it feels as though the Netherlands is the best place to build that life.

I've read up on Dutch immigration law (I don't have a European citizenship), but I'm not very familiar with the job market.

I've talked to Jan Bernhart, and he recommended you as the woman to talk to in circumstances such as mine. 

Do you think you can help me?





I've heard that you're well-connected in the tech sector. I've read up about Dutch immigration

Hi! I'm Greg, a software architect based in Israel. 

I've recently stepped down from a technical leadership position in a successful startup (the startup is still successful, in spite of it all).

It's become clear to me that I need to look for a different home, one free of constant warfare and strife. I've come to believe that I might find that home in the Netherlands.

I believe I have a lot to offer a potential employer, especially for Architect or Principal Engineer positions. Sadly, I don't know much about the job market in the Netherlands. 

I'm currently in Amsterdam as a tourist. I know this is an awkward time, with the holidays and all, but perhaps you can help me out with a short meeting and give me the lay of the land?

Thanks!

My CV is attached.

. The state still functions, but my existence within that state is one of anguish and pain. My conscience demands that I look for a different home, one free of constant warfare and strife.

I've come to believe that the Netherlands is the place to look for that home.

I'm quite good at what I do, and I have a lot to offer a potential employer. Besides my professional experience, I also have an assortment of impressive personal projects, and I've recently started a technical blog.

I don't have European citizenship, but I believe I can qualify for a Highly Qualified Migrant work visa, and I can also be considered Essential Start-up Personnel in several different fields.







'm a software architect currently based in Israel. But I no longer feel I have a future there.

I believe 

The political unrest in my country, combined with my personal views, have convinced me that I no longer have a future here.
