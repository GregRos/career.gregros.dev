Hey Elena! 

I'm Greg, a software architect based in Israel.

I've recently stepped down from a technical leadership position in a successful startup. The events in my country have convinced me that that I need to look for a different home, one free of constant warfare and strife. D

I also believe I have a lot to offer a potential employer, especially in Architect or Principal Engineer positions. Sadly, I don't know much about the job market in the Netherlands, and I would also need a visa sponsorship. 

I was hoping you could use your expertise in technical recruitment to help me get my bearings. I'd even appreciate a brief chat.

Thank you!

Please tell me you can help. I'd appreciate even a brief chat. 

Thank you!

With degrees in both technical and psychology domains, I  bridge the gap between colleagues and potential candidates effectively. I firmly believe that as an HR specialist and Recruiter, it's crucial to  strike a balance between employee and corporate needs. My solid  understanding empowers me to support both sides harmoniously.
