Hi! 

I'm Greg. I wanted to register for the site. 

I'm guessing this is where I show off. So here goes.

[Blog](https://gregros.dev) | [GitHub](https://github.com/GregRos)

I'm a developer and architect. I last worked in a startup where I designed and developed a technology for Chromium monitoring and control (in the name of client-side security), before using the same technology to build a major production system that processed lots of data with tons of demanding clients.

If you check out my blog, you'll find a bunch of in-depth articles about frontend stuff and web browsers, mainly for intermediate or senior-level developers. I think even my most generic material is pretty good and my articles have been liked wherever I've posted them. I plan on adding architecture content soon, though I have no idea how that will be received.

My views on architecture are pretty unique, since I didn't "grow up" in the enterprise mentality. I solved the same scalability problems while interfacing with stakeholders and whatnot, but I didn't beat around the bush doing it or walk around telling people how important I was. Though I guess I'm doing that now, so the joke is on me.

I'm big on communicating hard topics in a conversational, almost silly tone. I like to incorporate little bits of fun into the most technical things I do or write. Whatever I can get away with.

Besides that, I know a lot about language design and type systems. I've written in dozens of languages, and I've worked with TypeScript for years and even wrote [a proposal](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/55521) or [two](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/55280) for a major type system extension. It didn't go well, but I plan on revisiting it some day. 

I've worked on dozens open source libraries over the years including everything from parsing to protocol design to patching application binaries on the fly. I also have a revolutionary library for TypeScript code generation that's on the back burner because I'm busy with other stuff right now.

I think I am what happens when a person has too much inspiration.

The end.
